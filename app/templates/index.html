<h1>Welcome to Josh's scheduler app!</h1>
<br>
This is a python web app built with flask, using python 2.7, hosted on pythonanywhere.
<h3>How to use the scheduler</h3>
Right now the url is '/sched'. To find a new schedule make it /sched/[list] where the [list] is a list of the classes you want to take with a space between the letters and numbers, and a comma between each class.
<br>
<b>Note: </b>This is for the 2015F semester

<hr>
This is <b>not at all perfect yet</b>.Here are some known problems/things I should add:
    <li>This only schedules for fall 2015</li>
    <li>Many of the schedules the app makes still have conflicts</li>
    <li>The website looks awful</li>
    <li>There's no way to sort, like to see classes starting later first or something like that</li>
    <li><strike>I need to document and probably refactor the code better</strike></li>
    <li><strike>I really need to get the html/css organized for flask</strike></li>
    <li><strike>The scheduler page needs to be loaded twice</strike></li>
